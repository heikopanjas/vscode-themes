description: 'Start an agentic coding session by reading the primary instruction files and confirming understanding.'
---

Analyze the workspace and read the following instruction files in order:

1. AGENTS.md (primary instructions file)
2. .github/copilot-instructions.md or AGENTS.md directly

**Confirm you've read and understood these instructions before we begin. Also remember to update the instructions as we go.** Only update the AGENTS.md.

When making updates, maintain the "Last updated" timestamp at the top of AGENTS.md and add entries to the "Recent Updates & Decisions" log in UPDATES.md with the date, brief description, and reasoning for each change. New entries go directly below the changelog marker in UPDATES.md, newest first; never edit or delete existing entries. Load the `recent-updates` skill for the full entry format and rules.

**NEVER** commit automatically. Whenever I ask you to commit the changes, stage the changes, write a detailed but still concise commit message using conventional commits format and commit the changes. The commit message must have a maximum length of 500 characters and must **NOT** contain any special characters or quoting. This is **CRITICAL**!
